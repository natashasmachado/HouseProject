At the first I started the class "House" with the initializadors, setting the min and max capacites of the dimessions of the draw. I used de .asciiValue to restringe the characters required. After that, I set the default Char "x" and "*" for the construction of the house, border and fillings respective.
Variable perimeter which stores the sum of the sides of the draw.
Variable area which combines the area of the triangle and square together, this way, gives the total area of the draw.
Func grow extend the value of the area according with the parametrs of never more than 37 
Fuc shrink make the value of the area smaller according with the parametrs of never less than 3
Fuc draw are the respectives loops to output the shape of the house builded by spaces, bordes and fills. In order to do that, needs to set the centre of the figure first, from there add the spaces necessaries until gets to the border. Once in the border check the line and size of reference to proced to the loop.  Added the spaces, borders, filling, bordes and spaces until gets on the last line which is just compost for bordes.

Disclaimer : This assignment was a collaborative work between Alireza, Natasha and Ion, who in special led the others into the loop development.
